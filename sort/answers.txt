sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?:
This mean seems to take much more time than other two.
Because it compares only two numbers at one time and swap them, it's a slow way.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?:
Because this sort2 was the fastest way.
Merge sort splits list into two and then it starts sorting small to large. It can effectively sort list because of dividing.


sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?:
Selection sort can sort faster than Bubble sort, but later than Merge sort.
This mean sorts by picking smallest/largest numbers in list at that time.


307s sort1 bubble
057s sort2 marge
